- **Details**: System prevented overselling under extreme load
- **Performance**: 57-292ms latency, average 189ms

### Scenario 4: Waitlist Functionality ✅
- **Result**: Smart waitlist prevention when seats available  
- **Details**: System won't allow unnecessary waitlist entries
- **Validation**: Proper error messages and user guidance

### Scenario 5: Service Integration ✅
- **Result**: All internal APIs functional
- **Details**: User service auth, Event service seat updates working
- **Background Jobs**: Expiry processing endpoint operational

## 🔍 Critical Architecture Analysis

### **Optimistic Locking Implementation**
```
User A & B try booking simultaneously:
User A: GetEvent(version: 1) → UpdateAvailability(-2, version: 1) ✅ SUCCESS  
User B: GetEvent(version: 1) → UpdateAvailability(-2, version: 1) ❌ CONFLICT
Result: User A gets seats, User B gets "Please retry" (PERFECT)
```

### **Two-Phase Booking Flow**
```
Phase 1: Reserve (Atomic)
├── Event Service: UpdateAvailability(-N seats)
├── Database: Create booking (status: pending)  
├── Redis: Store reservation (TTL: 5 min)
└── Response: reservation_id + expires_at

Phase 2: Confirm (Atomic)  
├── Redis: Validate reservation exists
├── Payment: Process mock payment
├── Database: Update status to confirmed
├── Redis: Remove reservation
└── Response: booking_id + ticket_url
```

### **Concurrency Control Mechanisms**
1. **Database Level**: Optimistic locking with version fields
2. **Application Level**: Idempotency keys prevent duplicate bookings  
3. **Redis Level**: Rate limiting per user (10 req/min)
4. **Event Service**: Atomic seat decrement with version checks

---

## ⚠️ Identified Issues & Recommendations

### Issue 1: Cache Synchronization Lag
- **Problem**: Booking service shows stale seat counts for 30 seconds
- **Impact**: Users see incorrect availability during high-frequency booking periods
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Reduce cache TTL to 5-10 seconds for availability checks
  - Implement cache invalidation on seat updates
  - Add real-time WebSocket notifications for availability changes

### Issue 2: High Rejection Rate Under Extreme Load
- **Observation**: Only 16% success rate with 25 concurrent users
- **Analysis**: This is actually **correct behavior** preventing overselling
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Implement queue system for high-demand events
  - Add pre-reservation system during peak times
  - Provide better user feedback for retry attempts
